<p>
I shortly present my academic and personal interests here. If you
are curious and want to know more, just ask me. I have a strong
reputation of not biting people. <i class="far fa-smile"></i>
</p>
<h4>Researcher</h4>
<p>
As a researcher, my interest lies in the broad domain of
Software Engineering, with a tendency towards its practical
applications and empirical studies on software quality and
how to improve it. In
the <a href="http://www.testroots.org">TestRoots
project</a>, which was the focus of my PhD, I did this by
researching how developers test in their IDEs. I have also researched the testing aspects of Continuous Integration (see <a href="https://travistorrent.testroots.org/">TravisTorrent</a>) and
static code analysis, including code reviews.
</p>
<p>
<h4>Quality Enthusiast</h4>
<p>I am an absolute enthusiast in what I do. During my Bachelor and Master studies,
I already focused on Software Quality. I was a core committer of the
open-source software quality analysis toolkit ConQAT. Consequently,
I have a focus on writing maintainable, easy-to-understand source
code.</p>
<p>
<h4>Academic</h4>
<p>I studied Computer Science at Technical University of Munich, Germany, and
Linköpings Universitet, Sweden. On top of Software Engineering as
my specialisation, I chose a research-oriented Master education. During it, I submitted my first conference (rejected) and workshop paper (accepted) with my supervisor <a href="http://wwwbroy.in.tum.de/~juergens/">Elmar Jürgens</a>. I took Sports 
and Medicine as my minor fields of study. After my Masters, I did my PhD at Delft University of Technology in <a href="https://avandeursen.com/">Arie van Deursen's</a> <a href="https://se.ewi.tudelft.nl/">Empirical Software Engineering Research Group</a>, with <a href="https://azaidman.github.io/">Andy Zaidman</a> and <a href="https://gousios.gr/">Georgios Gousios</a>.</p>
<h4>Sportsman*</h4>
<p>In my leisure time, I enjoy
sports. After years of
competitive table tennis, I
picked up Olympic weight
lifting and climbing (in the
Netherlands!). Besides these
indoor activities, I like the
mountains. In the winter for
skiing, and in the summer for
hiking and a bit of mountain
biking. From time to time, I
<a href="https://gone-cycling.inventitech.com/">explore the Netherlands on a
race bike</a> or go for a run (not
really my favored sport,
though).</p>
<h4>Open-So(u)rcerer</h4>
<p>I am an avid contributor to
Open-Source Software (OSS). I lead
these OSS projects (varying degrees of popularity):
<ul><li><a href="http://travistorrent.testroots.org/">TravisTorrent</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.testroots.org">TestRoots WatchDog</a></li>
<li><a href="http://abstractformatter.inventitech.com">AbstractFormatter</a></li>
</ul>
I have contributed to the following projects:

dashboard for software projects. I was a core committer from
2009 through 2013 (Java).</li>

Horizons,</a> an Anno 1602-inspired strategy game

</ul>

<h4>Linguist</h4>
<p>Having a classicist's background (Latinum and Graecum), I
like language and speaking in general. From my abroad stays, I
have a particular interest in Dutch and Swedish culture. Besides I like to
pay attention to the little language details that matter.</p>
