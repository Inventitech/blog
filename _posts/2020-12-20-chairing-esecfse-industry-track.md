For its 2021 edition, Miltos Alamanis (of Microsoft Research) and myself were given the honor to chair the ESEC/FSE Industry Track. Only second to ICSE, this track is perhaps the prime venue in which practitioners and researchers come together to share their industry-related research. As such, Miltos and I wanted to get it right. We took a as data-driven as possible approach to do so. In lieu of not having a report (like ICSE usually prepares), we reached out to current and previous chairs of the track and studied previous calls for paper (CfPs) and Program Committee compositions.

- The CfP for the Industry Track had grown over the years, just like a legacy software system. Many different writing styles and some perhaps questionable advice had crept in. It was over-due for a big refactor.
- The community made advancements on important topics such as PC participation, open science, reviewing modes, and double-blind reviewing, which were not reflected in the CfP. We wanted to bring in current best practices, while adapting them to the Industry nature of the track. We also asked the community on this matter (https://twitter.com/Inventitech/status/1321739509495701506). Since this topic was somewhat controversial, we made it optional. It will be exciting to see how many papers made use of it in the end.

## Reviewing System
A system where only papers in with a chance of being accepted have to write a rebuttal. From experiene, I know that writing a good rebuttal can consume up to a day. We wanted to spare papers without hopes of making it into the conference this burden, and also limit the number of resources the PC spends on such papers.

## How do you fairly assemble a PC?
Engage reviewer-involvement by allowing external (self-)nominations. This ensured we were not limited to our own pool of reviewers. Moreover, we wanted a formal way for reviewers to engage with us, and not just the ones that would be curageous enough to write us an email ;-).

## PC size
We wanted to spread the load over as many shoulders as possible, while ensuring that everyone get at least ...
